# 🚨 SlopCop

A [BB](https://github.com/ymichael/bb) plugin that handles new GitHub issues and reviews pull requests.

Define **rules** with a prompt, repository, triggers, and conditions. SlopCop watches
GitHub, dispatches a BB agent, and verifies its response with the `gh` CLI. A rule can
listen for new issues, ready pull requests, new commits, or any combination.

```
GitHub  ←(gh)—  watcher  →  rule matcher  →  dispatcher  →  BB agent
                   │                                          │
             plugin SQLite  ←—— verified runs ——  gh issue / gh pr
```

## Install

Requires BB ≥ 0.35 and an authenticated [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) on the machine
running the BB server.

```sh
rift plugin install git:https://github.com/SawyerHood/bb-slop-cop.git@main
```

## Quick start

New rules start in **shadow mode**: they run the full review and store the body, but
post nothing. Read the result, then promote to live.

```sh
bb slopcop rules add \
  --name security-sweep \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --project my-project \
  --paths "src/auth/**,src/payments/**" \
  --prompt "Review the diff for auth and payment issues. Post findings with gh pr review --comment."

bb slopcop check security-sweep 482   # would it match? if not, exactly why not
bb slopcop dispatch security-sweep 482
bb slopcop show                       # the review it would have posted
bb slopcop rules edit security-sweep --live
```

Listen for new bug reports with the same rule system:

```sh
bb slopcop rules add \
  --name issue-triage \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --project my-project \
  --trigger new_issue \
  --label bug \
  --prompt "Triage the report. Ask for missing reproduction details and post the response."
```

The first issue poll records the open backlog. It does not dispatch agents for it.
Later issues dispatch once. A full review queue delays the event until a later poll.
The default trust gate handles only issues from repository members and collaborators.

To put all new review threads in one BB section, set its name or ID:

```sh
rift plugin config slopcop set defaultThreadSection "Automated reviews"
```

Clear the setting to create review threads without a section.

## Design notes

Three decisions do most of the work.

### The trust gate stops it running strangers' code

Reviewing a PR means the agent can run `gh pr checkout` on that branch and read the diff
into its own prompt. For an untrusted PR that is arbitrary code execution plus a prompt
injection surface, so rules default to **write access only**.

GitHub's `authorAssociation` is the signal, and its naming is a trap: **`CONTRIBUTOR`
means "has had a commit merged before", not write access.** A literal "contributors
only" filter still runs on a drive-by who landed one typo fix a year ago. Only
`OWNER` / `MEMBER` / `COLLABORATOR` imply write access, so only those are trusted by
default. `--trust past_contributors` and `--trust anyone` exist and are named honestly.
The same gate protects issue rules because issue text is also an untrusted prompt source.

Note that BB's permission modes are `full`, `auto`, and `accept-edits` — **none is
read-only**. There is no "run the agent sandboxed" option, so the trust gate is the
real protection rather than one layer of several.

### Comments are identifiable, and verified against GitHub

Every posted body carries a visible header so humans know it is a bot and which rule
wrote it, plus a hidden marker so SlopCop can find its own comments later:

```markdown
🚨 **SLOP COP** 🚨 · `security-sweep`

Three findings, one blocking…

<!-- slopcop:rule=security-sweep run=run_01J7X sha=a1b2c3d kind=summary -->
```

When the review thread finishes, SlopCop **does not trust the agent's transcript**. It
polls the applicable GitHub comment surfaces and matches on the marker. Pull request
runs use issue comments, inline comments, and review bodies. Issue runs use issue
comments. A run that claims success but posted nothing
is reported as `no_comment`, not as a success. If the header is present but the marker
is missing, the comment is still attributed — and flagged as prompt drift.

### Shadow mode makes a prompt change safe to test

A rule's prompt is the whole product, and prompts drift. Shadow mode runs the real
review or issue response against a real target. It stores the exact body without a
GitHub write, so a prompt change can be tested before it is visible to your team.

## Running under a bot identity

By default SlopCop reads and posts as whoever `gh` is logged in as — you. Point the
`botGhPath` setting at a wrapper that exports a bot `GH_TOKEN` and execs `gh`, and the
poller, the verifier, and the spawned review agent all switch to that identity. Your own
`gh` login is untouched, because the token never leaves the wrapper's process tree. The
agent is told the command name, never a token.

`scripts/slopcop-gh` is that wrapper for a GitHub App. It mints an installation token,
caches it in `~/.slopcop/token.cache.json` until ten minutes before expiry, and execs
`gh`. Any wrapper works; the plugin only cares that the command behaves like `gh`.

On the GitHub side. Own the app at the organization, not at a personal account —
an app owned by a person dies with that person's access:

1. Open `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps/new`.
2. Clear the **Webhook → Active** checkbox. SlopCop polls, so it needs no webhook.
3. Grant repository permissions: Pull requests **Read and write**, Issues
   **Read and write**, Contents **Read-only**, Metadata **Read-only**.
4. Create the app. Record the App ID. Generate a private key and save the `.pem` file.
5. Install the app on every repo a rule watches. The poller reads through the same
   identity, so a missing installation fails the poll for that repo.
6. Record the installation ID from the install URL.

`gh` cannot create or install an app — neither action has a REST endpoint that a user
token can call. It can do everything after that, because `gh api` respects an explicit
`-H Authorization`:

```sh
gh api -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" /orgs/<org>/installation --jq .id
```

To skip the permissions form, use the [app manifest flow][manifest] instead of step 1.
You approve one browser page, then `gh api -X POST /app-manifests/$CODE/conversions`
returns the App ID and the private key in its response body.

[manifest]: https://docs.github.com/apps/sharing-github-apps/registering-a-github-app-from-a-manifest

On this machine:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.slopcop && chmod 700 ~/.slopcop
mv ~/Downloads/slopcop.*.private-key.pem ~/.slopcop/slopcop.private-key.pem
chmod 600 ~/.slopcop/slopcop.private-key.pem
cat > ~/.slopcop/app.json <<'JSON'
{ "appId": "123456", "installationId": "78901234",
  "privateKeyPath": "~/.slopcop/slopcop.private-key.pem" }
JSON
cp scripts/slopcop-gh ~/.slopcop/slopcop-gh
~/.slopcop/slopcop-gh slopcop-login       # expect "<app-slug>[bot]"
```

An installation token is not a user, so `gh api user` returns 403 under the wrapper.
GitHub publishes no whoami for such a token. `slopcop-login` derives the bot login from
the app slug instead, and `authenticatedLogin()` falls back to it. Without that, the
account guard in `verifyLive` would disarm and count anyone's comment as possibly ours.

Then set `botGhPath` to `~/.slopcop/slopcop-gh` and check `bb slopcop status`.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Comments post as `your-app[bot]`, so `--request-changes` now works on your own PRs.
  GitHub blocks that only when the reviewer is the PR author.
- The agent runs as your Unix user, so it can read the key if it tries. A separate OS
  user or a container is the only real isolation.

Plugin settings: `defaultThreadSection` accepts a BB thread section name or ID.
SlopCop fails a run with a clear error if that section no longer exists. `botGhPath`
switches every GitHub call to a bot identity — see above.

Rule flags: `--name --repo --project --provider --model --reasoning --permission
--prompt --paths --base --label --skip-label --trust --requester-trust --dedupe
--strategy --trigger --keyword --live --shadow --disabled --hidden --visible`.
Add `--json` to any command.

An issue-only rule selects issues automatically for manual commands. Use `--issue` for
a rule that listens to both target types.

## Rules

| Field             | Meaning                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repo`            | One `owner/repo` per rule                                                                     |
| `triggers`        | `ready_for_review`, `new_commits`, `new_issue`, `pr_description_matches`, `comment_matches`   |
| `commentKeywords` | Case-insensitive literal tokens used by description and comment triggers                      |
| `conditions`      | Labels, author, and title apply to all targets. Paths, base, and diff size apply only to PRs. |
| `authorTrust`     | `write_access` (default), `past_contributors`, `anyone`                                       |
| `requesterTrust`  | Who can request a review through a comment; `write_access` by default                         |
| `mode`            | `shadow` (default) or `live`                                                                  |
| `dedupe`          | `once_per_pr`, `once_per_head_sha`, or `once_per_trigger_event`                               |
| `visibility`      | `visible` (default) or `hidden` review threads                                                |

### Keyword-triggered reviews

Use a keyword trigger to run a rule only after an explicit request:

```sh
bb slopcop rules add \
  --name requested-review \
  --repo owner/repo \
  --project <bb-project-name> \
  --trigger comment_matches,pr_description_matches \
  --keyword "@slopcop" \
  --requester-trust write_access \
  --dedupe once_per_trigger_event
```

Keywords use case-insensitive, complete-token matches. `@slopcop-test` does not
match `@slopcop`. General PR comments and inline review comments can request a
review. The bot ignores its own comments. An allowed commenter can request a
review on any open PR, regardless of the PR author's trust level.

The description trigger checks a new ready PR. It also checks a draft when the
author marks it ready. Later description edits do not trigger a review. Comment
polling starts when the trigger becomes active, so old comments do not run it.

### Run statuses

`shadowed` · `commented` · `commented_partial` / `commented_unmarked` /
`commented_unattributed` (posted, attribution degraded) · `no_comment` (finished
without posting) · `skipped` (matched nothing, e.g. blocked by the trust gate) ·
`failed`.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npx vitest run     # matcher, markers, triggers, verification
npx tsc --noEmit
rift plugin install .
rift plugin dev      # rebuild + reload on save
```

The interesting logic is pure and unit-tested: `lib/matcher.ts` (globs, trust gate,
trigger edges), `lib/marker.ts` (header/marker attribution), `lib/verify.ts` (the two
verification modes). `server.ts` is mostly wiring.

Two things worth knowing before changing storage or GitHub reads:

- **Migrations are keyed by statement index.** `MIGRATIONS` in `lib/db.ts` is strictly
  append-only — an inserted statement inherits an already-applied index and is silently
  skipped.
- **`gh pr list --json` has no `authorAssociation` field.** It only exists in the REST
  API, which is why all PR reads go through `gh api`.
